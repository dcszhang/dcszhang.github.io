## Ongoing Project

  **Smart Contract Fraud Detection**  
   This project, conducted during my visit to Singapore Management University under[Prof.Yue Duan](https://yueduan.github.io/index.html), focuses on developing a system to detect scams in smart contracts. By using static analysis techniques on contract bytecode, the system identifies vulnerabilities and malicious behaviors, contributing to enhanced security in blockchain ecosystems.

## Early Project

- **AI and Blockchain Fraud Detection**  
   As part of my research at Zhejiang University with  [Prof.Haitao Xu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/haitaoxu), I proposed the ETH-GBERT model, which combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and BERT to detect fraudulent activities in blockchain transactions. The project involved designing a multimodal learning framework, creating a data pipeline for transaction analysis, and achieving significant improvements over baseline models.

- **Acoustic Beam-Tracing Software GPU Acceleration**  
   In this project, I accelerated an industrial acoustic simulation software using CUDA. By optimizing memory access patterns, parallel execution strategies, and hardware resource utilization, I achieved a nearly 800x performance improvement. This work also involved rewriting and restructuring legacy code for GPU compatibility.

- **GPUPixel Project**  
   During my internship at [iFlytek AI Research Institute](https://www.iflytek.com/en), I worked on the GPUPixel rendering framework. I implemented features such as virtual server-based rendering, enhanced image output functionality, and EGL adaptation to improve the system's performance and future compatibility.

- **Acoustic Beam-Tracing Software Refactoring**  
   I refactored a 7,000-line Fortran acoustic simulation software into C++. This work focused on ensuring functional consistency, improving code maintainability, and preparing the system for subsequent optimizations and extensions.

- **E-commerce Recommendation System**  
   For my undergraduate thesis, I designed and implemented a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The system analyzed user behavior, search history, and purchasing patterns to deliver personalized product recommendations. 

- **GPS and Sensor Technology for Epidemic Prevention**  
   This project focused on integrating GPS and sensor data to improve epidemic prevention measures. I led the design and development of the system, including architecture planning, frontend interface creation, and backend interaction testing. The project also produced a research report summarizing the theoretical and practical findings.
