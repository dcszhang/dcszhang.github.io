# About Me

<!-- <img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic"> -->

Here is **Zhang Sheng (张升)**.<br>

I am currently a postgraduate student in Network and Information Security at Hefei University of Technology, and I expect to **graduate in June 2025**. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Taiyuan University of Science and Technology. During my postgraduate studies, I have focused on research in **blockchain security**, **smart contract analysis**, and **GPU acceleration**.

In terms of research experience, I have been involved in several projects. At **Zhejiang University**, I worked with Prof. [Haitao Xu's research group](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/haitaoxu) on blockchain transaction fraud detection. 

Currently, I am a visiting student in Prof. [Yue Duan's group](https://yueduan.github.io/) at **Singapore Management University(SMU)**, where I am working on static analysis of smart contract bytecode to develop a system for scam detection. These experiences have deepened my understanding of blockchain and smart contract security challenges and equipped me with both theoretical and practical expertise.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at  **dcszhang[at]foxmail[dot]com**

## Research Interests

**I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2026 Spring admission. If you have any information, please contact me!**

- GPU Architecture
- Blockchain Fraud Detection
- Smart Contract Analysis

My current research interests lie in **Code analysis for smart contracts**, a field where I find both intellectual challenge and enjoyment. My undergraduate and master's experiences have shaped my skills and deepened my passion for exploring this area. Additionally, analyzing and researching **GPU architectures**, particularly their design and optimization, excites me just as much, as it combines my technical expertise with my enthusiasm for high-performance computing.

## I have developed the following research competency scale:

- **L1: Beginner (Research Novice)**  
   - Lacks both the ability to propose ideas and implement them. A pure research novice.

- **L2: Guided Implementation**  
   - With full guidance from the advisor, has developed basic skills to implement the advisor's ideas.  
   - Acquires preliminary mastery of tools within the current field of study.  
   - Typically publishes the first full-workload paper at this stage.  

- **L3: Proficient Implementer**  
   - With full guidance from the advisor, can effectively implement the advisor's ideas.  
   - Implementation approaches are about 75% aligned with the advisor's vision.  
   - Gains comprehensive mastery of tools in the research field.  
   - Publishes the first top-tier paper during this stage and starts to understand potential future research directions in the field.  
   - Begins to develop the ability to propose new ideas.

- **L4: Independent Researcher**  
   - Proposes ideas that are frequently recognized by the advisor.  
   - With partial guidance, can quickly implement ideas and independently complete experiments.  
   - Forms an initial "research taste."  
   - Rapidly increases the number of first-author papers and starts gaining recognition in the research community of the specific field.  

- **L5: Established Research Leader**  
   - Fully capable of proposing and implementing original ideas.  
   - Begins mentoring students and leading projects.  
   - Collaborates with major groups in the research field on significant projects.  
   - Sees a rapid growth in the number of corresponding-author papers.  
   - Achieves a stable standing in the academic research community.

#### Current Status and Goals

- **Current Level:** L3  
   I am currently at the **L3 stage**, where I can effectively implement my advisor's ideas with guidance. My implementation approaches align closely with the advisor’s vision, and I have published papers that demonstrate my growing expertise in the field.  

- **Next Milestone:** L4  
   My goal is to advance to **L4** by completing my current project. I aim to further develop my ability to independently propose innovative ideas, design research plans, and execute experiments with reduced reliance on guidance.  

- **PhD Objective:** Graduate from L4  
   Through my PhD studies, I aspire to fully achieve **L4**, where I can independently propose and implement ideas, establish my unique research identity, and make significant contributions to my field while gaining broader recognition within the research community.
